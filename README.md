# Note Taker

## Description

I wanted to build a Note Taker using the express npm dependency to expose myself to operating on both the client and server side. This gave me a good bridge of knowledge between the two, and understanding middleware better. I could possibly create different files for routes and apis to cut down my server.js file, but I was focused on exercising the knowledge I gathered. 

## Installation

If downloading the file and running locally from the Visual Code Studio
1. Open the server.js file in the integrated termianl
2. Use the command "npm i" to install the dependencies needed for this challenge (express)
3. Use the command "npm start" to begin the PORT listening and type in http://localhost:3001/ to direct to the main page

You can use the Heroku Deployment to use the application
